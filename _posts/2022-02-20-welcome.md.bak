## and why am I here?
The internet is a fascinating place, full of seemingly endless opportunities to make and share your vision. In reality we're all just shouting into the void in the hope that someone hears us. But despite being on Twitter,
the original home of shouting your views to anyone who might listen, I've never felt able to just throw a thought into 140, or later 280, characters and fire it out into the world. I've always just felt that no-one is
likely to read my thoughts, or care about them. Throw in a dash of impostor syndrome - the feeling that I don't really have the knowledge, or the right, to spout off on any particular subject, and the likelihood of me
hitting go on a tweet is minimal.
This of course is likely true of many, and the answer may be to just keep on shouting until someone listens - there's plenty of posters out there who certainly don't worry about being right all the time! 
But I wonder if I really want all that attention, and whether in fact I just want the catharsis of writing things down, sharing my thoughts somewhere where they _could_ be read by others, but are in reality unlikely to be
stumbled upon.

### The Internet - a box with a light on it?
So, with a feeling of desire to share something with the world, and the best that late 90's/early 2000's IT education can offer (basic HTML for everyone!) I thought about how best to stamp my thoughts on the internet, if
only in my little corner of it? My knowledge of **The INTERNET** would probably be best described as "Dangerous Noob". I know enough to stumble in the right direction, but very quickly get out of my depth. This is despite
the best efforts of an excellent (and patient) friend to educate me in the details! Years ago I had a couple of websites, which were mainly excuses to bash bits of HTML and CSS together - I even briefly dabbled with some
PHP. But even though one was a functioning outward facing site for an amateur organisation, I wouldn't have titled myself Webmaster (although I definitely did - I had a webmaster@ email and everything!).
